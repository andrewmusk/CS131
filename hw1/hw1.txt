Set Functions:

For these functions, the main thing I was considering was readability, conciseness and making the functions simple.
Once I had established how to do the first few functions, the rest followed similar patterns. In doing these functions
I choose solving them manually, rather than using the List functions. I felt that this improved my skill more and also
made the code more readable. I could have added more base cases that might have made the functions run faster, however,
in most cases I avoided these as they made the solution more complex. 

Grammar Filter:

For the grammar filter I started with the root nonterminal value in the grammar and went through each rule to see if 
it was reachable from the root. I originally tried to go through all of the rules and check if the current rule was reachable
by going backwards however this proved harder to write than my original solution. I feel like my current solution that seems 
like breath first search is better anyways in it's simplicity.
